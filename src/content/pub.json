        "abstract": "Wireless sensing has great significance in Internet of Things (IoT) applications and has attracted substantial research interests in academia. In this study, we propose Palantir, a first-of-its-kind long-range sensing system based on the LoRa backscatter technology. By utilizing the ON-OFF-Keying modulated backscatter signals, Palantir can perform fine-grained long-range cyclist sensing. Our findings show that sensing is more susceptible to channel quality than communication. Hence, the design of Palantir particularly addresses the critical challenges of signal processing, such as amplitude instability, frequency offset, clock drift, spectrum leakage, and multiplicative noise. We implement Palantir and evaluate its performance by conducting comprehensive benchmark experiments. A prototype is also built and a case study of respiration monitoring in the real world is implemented. Results demonstrate that Palantir can perform accurate sensing at a range up to 100 m, which is twice that of state-of-the-art approaches. The median deviation of the detected motion period is as low as 0.2%."

        "abstract": "The radio range of backscatter systems continues growing as new wireless communication primitives are continuously invented. Nevertheless, both the bit error rate and the packet loss rate of backscatter signals increase rapidly with the radio range, thereby necessitating the cooperation between the access point and the backscatter tags through a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the low-power nature of backscatter tags limits their ability to demodulate feedback signals from a remote access point and scales down to such circumstances. This paper presents Saiyan, an ultra-low-power demodulator for long-range LoRa backscatter systems. With Saiyan, a backscatter tag can demodulate feedback signals from a remote access point with moderate power consumption and then perform an immediate packet re-transmission in the presence of packet loss. Moreover, Saiyan enables rate adaption and channel hopping – two PHY-layer operations that are important to channel efficiency yet unavailable on long-range backscatter systems. We prototype Saiyan on a two-layer PCB board and evaluate its performance in different environments. Results show that Saiyan achieves 3.5–5× gain on the demodulation range, compared with state-of-the-art systems. Our ASIC simulation shows that the power consumption of Saiyan is around 93.2 µW."

        "abstract": "This paper presents RF-Transformer, a unified backscatter radio hardware abstraction that allows a low-power IoT device to directly communicate with heterogeneous wireless receivers at the minimum power consumption. Unlike existing backscatter systems that are tailored to a specific wireless communication protocol, RF-Transformer provides a programmable interface to the micro-controller, allowing IoT devices to synthesize different types of protocol-compliant backscatter signals sharing radically different PHY-layer designs. To show the efficacy of our design, we implement a PCB prototype of RF-Transformer on 2.4 GHz ISM band and showcase its capability on generating standard ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ac packets. Our extensive field studies show that RF-Transformer achieves 23.8 Mbps, 247.1 Kbps, 986.5 Kbps, and 27.3 Kbps throughput when generating standard Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LoRa signals while consuming 7.6–74.2× less power than their active counterparts. Our ASIC simulation based on the 65-nm CMOS process shows that the power gain of RF-Transformer can further grow to 92–678×. We further integrate RF-Transformer with pressure sensors and present a case study on detecting foot traffic density in hallways. Our 7-day case studies demonstrate RFTransformer can reliably transmit sensor data to a commodity gateway by synthesizing LoRa packets on top of Wi-Fi signals. Our experimental results also verify the compatibility of RF-Transformer with commodity receivers."

    "abstract": "WiFi-based device localization is a key enabling technology for smart applications, which has attracted numerous research studies in the past decade. Most of the existing approaches rely on Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals to work, while a critical problem is often neglected: In the real-world indoor environments, WiFi signals are everywhere, but very few of them are usable for accurate localization. As a result, the localization accuracy in practice is far from being satisfactory. This paper presents BIFROST, a novel hardware-software co-design for accurate indoor localization. The core idea of BIFROST is to reinvent WiFi signals, so as to provide sufficient LoS signals for localization. This is realized by exploiting the dispersion effect of signals emitted by the leaky wave antenna (LWA). We present a low-cost plug-in design of LWA that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. In the software layer, fine-grained information in Channel State Information (CSI) is exploited to cope with multipath and noise. We implement BIFROST and evaluate its performance under various settings. The results show that the median localization error of BIFROST is 0.81m, which is 52.35% less than that of SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach. SpotFi, when combined with BIFROST to work in the realistic settings, can reduce the localization error by 33.54%. "
